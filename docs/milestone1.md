Application web name: 
    Disabler

Description: 
    Our goal for the website is for the disbilities people can find assitance to perform short term/urgent tasks, such as doing chores, buying groceries, etc.
    
    Currently there is a similar app, which is Red Panic button. However, it's more of an emergency problems for the people. Also, there are several more apps that helps people with specific disability, like DPA: helps people with traveling, HelpTalk: helps people with speech impairment, etc. But there are still no solution to the help with the basic needs for the disabilities.


Innovative Idea:
    The apps style is similar to Uber, but instead of asking for rides, the disabilites will ask for assistance around the neighborhood, with the design of clicking options, instead of typing down, thus this would help more people with disabilities. People around the neighborhood will be pinged when someone request something and help them with the task.

User Interaction:
- There will be 2 types of people logging in the website:
    + Assistance (people with no disabilities):
        * They will log in to their account and input credentials information.
        * They will also be rated (5 stars) based on how they well treat that people.  
        
    + Disabilities people:
        * Logging in and creating an account will be easier with some features assistance (will be figured out along the way). They can choose their type of disablities to give more information for the assistance (This is optional since someone might not feel comfortable sharing it).
        * They will select from a fixed number of options of tasks and then press FIND to find someone (for now the number of tasks will only be simple with: buy groceries, do chores, walking).
        * Then they will wait for the assistance to accept the tasks and perform it.
        * The disabilities person can cancel the person if after they read the profile while waiting. 

    + There will be a notification when the assistance accept the tasks, and their info will be briefly displayed (accessible for people with disabilities) (to be figured out later)
    + The map will be showing after the disabilities click find someone to show how far the assitance is. (That's the idea, we will change accordingly when we implementing it)
